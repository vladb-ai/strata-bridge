//! CPFP package construction + aggressive RBF for [`TxDriver`](crate::tx_driver::TxDriver).
//!
//! Bridge presigned transactions pay a protocol-floor fee rate (`fee::FEE_RATE = 2 sat/vB`).
//! On any non-trivial network load they get evicted from the mempool before confirming. To drive
//! them to confirmation we build a CPFP child that lifts the **package** (parent + child) fee
//! rate to whatever the fee source reports as the current target, RBF'ing the child on each
//! new block. Package fee accounting only — the child's per-vB rate can far exceed the operator's
//! `max_fee_rate` as long as the package average doesn't.
//!
//! ## Design summary
//!
//! - [`CpfpStrategy`] tells the driver how to derive a CPFP child for a given parent kind.
//! - [`CpfpContext`] bundles the dependencies the bump loop needs (wallet, fee source, anchor
//!   signer, max fee rate, package submitter).
//! - [`perform_bump`] is the single source of truth for the bump loop: it queries the fee source,
//!   builds the child via the wallet, signs the anchor input via the operator's secret service
//!   (through a caller-provided closure), and submits `[parent, child]` via
//!   [`submit_package`](crate::submitpackage::submit_package).
//! - Termination is driven by the parent confirming (the existing mempool-event branch in
//!   `TxDriver` notifies the wait-condition listener). The bump function itself is stateless per
//!   call — it carries the last-attempted rate and last-child-funding-inputs through the
//!   [`CpfpHandle`] state owned by the driver.
//!
//! ## What's intentionally NOT here
//!
//! - This module does not own ZMQ subscriptions; that's the driver's job.
//! - This module does not retry on its own — each `perform_bump` is one attempt. The driver
//!   re-calls on the next trigger (mempool eviction or new block).
//! - This module does not escalate past `max_fee_rate`. Cap-and-warn per the operator's policy.
