//! The [`GeneralWallet`] trait — abstraction over the operator's general-purpose funds
//! (the wallet that fronts payments, pays CPFP fees, and tops up other internal pools).
//! The trait isolates the surface that genuinely varies between backends; concrete
//! implementations live in submodules.
//!
//! Everything that doesn't vary between backends — leasing, the reserved wallet, anchor
//! filtering, cross-wallet transaction construction — lives on the composer
//! [`crate::OperatorWallet<G>`] that wraps a `GeneralWallet`.
