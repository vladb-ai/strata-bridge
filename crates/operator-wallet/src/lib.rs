//! Operator wallet — composition over a swappable [`GeneralWallet`] backend.
//!
//! Callers hold an `OperatorWallet<G>` where `G: GeneralWallet`. The composer owns:
//! - a descriptor-only reserved wallet (BDK), signed downstream by the caller,
//! - the in-memory lease set shared across both wallets,
//! - CPFP-anchor identification and exclusion from input selection,
//! - cross-wallet construction helpers that pay from the general wallet into reserved-wallet
//!   outputs of a caller-specified denomination.
//!
//! The [`GeneralWallet`] backend handles only what varies between implementations: its own
//! UTXO discovery, its own signing, and the funding+CPFP construction primitives.
//!
//! Methods on [`OperatorWallet`] are `&mut self`. Callers serialize via an outer lock when
//! they need a multi-step critical section (e.g. DB-lookup-then-fund-then-persist).
