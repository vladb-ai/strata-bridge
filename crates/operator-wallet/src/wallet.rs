//! The [`OperatorWallet`] composer.
//!
//! Composes a swappable [`crate::GeneralWallet`] backend with an always-native reserved wallet
//! and shared in-memory lease bookkeeping. The composer owns:
//!
//! - the BDK descriptor-only reserved wallet (signed downstream by the caller),
//! - the lease set shared across both wallets,
//! - anchor exclusion during input selection,
//! - cross-wallet construction helpers that produce PSBTs paying from the general wallet into
//!   reserved-wallet outputs of a caller-specified denomination.
//!
//! Methods on [`OperatorWallet`] take `&mut self`; callers serialize via an outer lock when
//! they need a multi-step critical section (e.g. DB-lookup-then-fund-then-persist).
