//! ASM event feed client.
//!
//! Expectations:
//! - ASM RPC tracks the same chain and has already ingested blocks before we request
//!   `get_assignments(block_hash)`. We treat the BTC block notification as a signal that ASM should
//!   already have executed that block.
//! - If ASM is briefly behind, retries are expected to bridge the gap. The fetcher assumes eventual
//!   availability and keeps the main loop non-blocking.
//! - If ASM is persistently behind due to configuration/connectivity, requests can keep failing for
//!   "new" blocks. This is not expected behavior, but it can happen and should show up as repeated
//!   retries/failures in logs/metrics.
//! - If ASM follows a different fork, the notified block hash may not exist on ASM. This can
//!   surface as "block not found" responses; we currently log/skip after retries.
// TODO: <https://alpenlabs.atlassian.net/browse/STR-2667>
// Explicitly detect lag vs. fork divergence and surface a clear health signal.
